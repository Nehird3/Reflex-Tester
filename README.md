# Reflex-Tester
Reflex tester implemented with VHDL programming language for a BASYS3 FPGA board.

The primary goal of this task is to build a project using BASYS3 FPGA and analog components. This experiment seeks to assess how quickly you can respond after receiving a visual stimulus, or rather your hand-eye coordination. The user must click the "start" button to activate a random number generator that turns on the "output led" at random intervals (randomness is key here, since the time of led on can be learned). There ought to be a "reset" button to clear all the states and prepare the device for the following reflex test, and the 7-segment display should show a "hi" message to signal that it is ready for the next input. The timer commences and counts the time until the user pushes the "stop" button, at which point the reaction time should be shown on the 7-segment display and the “hi” word should be erased. At the end of the project, messages will be displayed on the  VGA screen according to the reflex seconds. “Well Done” is between 1 and 3 seconds, 3 to 6 seconds is “Not Bad”, and 6-infinity is “Bad Reflexes”.
